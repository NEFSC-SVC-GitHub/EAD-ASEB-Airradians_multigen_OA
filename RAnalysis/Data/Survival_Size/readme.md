### About files in folder 'Survival_Size'

**Juvenile_lengths_master.csv (and excel worksheet)**

- contains all measurements of size throughout the experiment 
		
- note: these data are from complete sets or randomly chosen subsets measured *non-destructively* for lengths amoung OA treatment and replicate tank;
		these are not to be confused with the scallops destructively sampled for our suite of physiological measurements (respiration, clearance,ammonia excretion, etc.), as these were chosen based on mean size / size class
		
		
		
**TDW_AFDW_Condition_master.csv (and excel worksheet)**

- contains all dry tissue/shell and afdw
		
- note: a fed v. unfed experiment occured on 9/30/21 and 10/26/2021 (manuscript in prep as of 2/4/22), only scallops from the 'fed' treatment are represented here 
		as starvation likely depleted/hindered tissue accretion for meaningful comparison to the other data and to avoid confounding downstream DEB models
		
- in all cases, dry weights (tissue dry weight 'TDW' and shell dry weight 'SDW') were completed after 36-72 hours at 60 Celcius.  Only whole dry weights (w/o dissection of tissue from shell) were measured
		for scallops on 9/14/21 and 9/30/21 due to size and shell fragility for accurate separation of tissue from shell
		
- two condition indecies are shown here calculated as (1)[TDW/SDW]*100 (2) [AFDW/shell length]*1000
		
- In the 'notes' column...:
			
	* 'scallops used for RR and CR' = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and handled for respiration rate and clearance prior to dry weight/ash weight
			
	* 'extras, also depurated       = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and not used for suite of physiological measurements
