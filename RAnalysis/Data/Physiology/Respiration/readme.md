**'start.end_timestamps'** 

	* time points marking the start ad the end of each channel for respiration trial 
	
	* why? 
		
		* ammonia values were calculated from the seawater in the respiration chamber over the full duration of the trial, therefore the cumulative oxygen consumed is the relevant value for the O:N ratio
