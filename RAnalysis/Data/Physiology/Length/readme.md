## About files in folder 'Length'

#### folders as 'YYYMMDD'

- each contains data separated by generation **'F1, F2, etc.'**

### (i) 'cumulative_raw' folder

* csv files of the compiled data from *worksheets* as a single table for ease of import and analysis in R

### (ii) 'worksheets' folder

* excel files uploaded from our shared project google drive - often containing tabs for separate dates and draft figures to visualize periodically

* note: this day is *raw* but not formatted in a manner to import into and R for statistical analysis, summary, and visualization

### Notes:

- length  data are from complete tank measurements or randomly chosen subsets measured *non-destructively* for lengths among OA treatments and replicate tanks; these are not to be confused with the scallops destructively sampled for our suite of physiological measurements (respiration, clearance,ammonia excretion, etc.), as these were chosen based on mean size / size class
