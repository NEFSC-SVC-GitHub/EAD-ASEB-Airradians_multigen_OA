## About files in folder 'Survival_Size'

### Data management 

**'F1, F2, etc.'**

	* data separated by scallop generation

**'worksheet'**

	* excel files uploaded from our shared project google drive - often containing tabs for separete dates and draft figures to visualize periodically
	
	* note: this day is *raw* but not formatted in a manner to import into and R for statistical anylysis, summary, and visualization

**'cumualtive_raw'**

	* csv files of the compiled data from *worksheets* as a single table for ease of import and analysis in R 


### other specifics

**length (excel worksheets and raw cumulative csvs)**

- contains all measurements of survival, shell length, dry weights (tissue, as free dry weight dry shell, etc.)

- note: these data are from complete tank measurmentnts  or randomly chosen subsets measured *non-destructively* for lengths amoung OA treatment and replicate tanks;
		these are not to be confused with the scallops destructively sampled for our suite of physiological measurements (respiration, clearance,ammonia excretion, etc.), as these were chosen based on mean size / size class


** dry weight.csv (excel worksheets and raw cumulative csvs)**

- contains all dry tissue/shell and afdw

- note: a fed v. unfed experiment occured on 9/30/21 and 10/26/2021 (manuscript in prep as of 2/4/22), only scallops from the 'fed' treatment are represented here

- in all cases, dry weights (tissue dry weight 'TDW' and shell dry weight 'SDW') were completed after 36-72 hours at 60 Celcius.  Only whole dry weights (w/o dissection of tissue from shell) were measured
		for scallops on 9/14/21 and 9/30/21 due to size and shell fragility for accurate separation of tissue from shell

- two condition indices are measured using several methods

- In the 'notes' column...:

	* 'scallops used for RR and CR' = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and handled for respiration rate and clearance prior to dry weight/ash weight

	* 'extras, also depurated       = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and not used for suite of physiological measurements
