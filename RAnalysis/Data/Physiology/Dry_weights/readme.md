## About files in folder 'Dry_weights'

#### folders as 'YYYMMDD'

- each contains data separated by generation **'F1, F2, etc.'**


### (i) 'cumulative_raw' folder

* csv files of the compiled data from *worksheets* as a single table for ease of import and analysis in R

### (ii) 'worksheets' folder

* excel files uploaded from our shared project google drive - often containing tabs for separate dates and draft figures to visualize periodically

* note: this day is *raw* but not formatted in a manner to import into and R for statistical analysis, summary, and visualization

#### Notes:

- contains all dry tissue/shell and afdw

- the fed v. unfed experiment occurred on 9/30/21 and 10/26/2021 (manuscript in prep as of 2/4/22), only scallops from the 'fed' treatment are represented in the cumulative raw - you will see 'unfed' in the worksheets

- in all cases, dry weights (tissue dry weight 'TDW' and shell dry weight 'SDW') were completed after 36-72 hours at 60 Celcius.  Only whole dry weights (w/o dissection of tissue from shell) were measured for scallops on 9/14/21 and 9/30/21 due to size and shell fragility for accurate separation of tissue from shell

- after a few months of growth out we decided to dissect tissue into compartments, gonad, adductor, and somatic - prior to this we solely separated full tissue from shell. **Please review the .xlxs format of the cumulative raw data, as the equations differ! -- depending on solely shell & tissue OR shell, gonad, somatic, and adductor!**

- In the 'notes' column...:

	* 'scallops used for RR and CR' = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and handled for respiration rate and clearance prior to dry weight/ash weight

	* 'extras, also depurated  = data pertaining to animals post 24-hour depuration and not used for suite of physiological measurements
