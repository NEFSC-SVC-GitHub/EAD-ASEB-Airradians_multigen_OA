# Data/Physiology


## What is in this folder? & How is the data organized?

**About**

All data for this project was initially input (either directly or uploaded) to the google drive in a raw form, here
(depending on the data type), calculations were occasionally made in google sheets to aquire certain values. Data in this raw form (google drive/sheets)
are rarely organized for statistical software.

Subfolders titled **worksheets** and **cumulative_raw** data:

* **worksheets** - untouched direct downloads from the google drive, worksheets meaning you will find test figures, multiple tabs, calculated data, etc. here. **Not suitable** for statistical analysis, but a reference to the raw input format!

* **cumulative_raw** - cosolidated data from all relevant worksheets (google drive raw format) to proper organization for downstream plotting and analysis

* Note: feel free to cross-validate whether the cumulative raw lines up with the worksheets, this has been done already but a good practice to become familiar with our organization!

## Subfolders here, in breif..

### Biodeposition

* F1 and F2 data each with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis

### Clearance_rates

* F1 data  with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis
* Note: three clearance rate timepoints (9/14 9/90 and 10/26/21) were all used int he Food x OA manuscript!
The only timepoint that is not in a preexisting paper is 2/2/2022 (as of 1/19/2024)

### Dry_weights

* F1 and F2 data each with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis

### Excretion_rates

* F1 and F2 data each with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis

### Images

* ImageJ_Respiration_lengths - contains the images taken via microscopy for  larvae respiration rates on 08/30/2022

### Length

* F1 and F2 data each with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis


### Parentages

* the google drive upload of the recorded parentages that contributed to the F1s, F2s, and F3s

* note the IDs marked with 'X' are those that contributed gametes for fertilization batches - and are those that were sequenced!

### Respiration

* NOTE: these data are a bit different, as data records are very long and differ based on the format of the intrument used (LoLigo or Presens)

* metadata and raw folders

* **metadata** - since raw data is recorded solely as channels/sensor numbers, we need to have corect metadata to relate the sensor to the individual scallop (ID, treamnt, size, etc.). **a README is included in the Respiration folder for more details!!!**

* **raw** - organized by date as yyymmdd each containing the data in *raw format directly uploaded from the instrument* there is no calculation or manupulation of these data - true raw form!

### Survival

* F1 and F2 data each with the worksheets and the cumulative raw format for plotting and analysis
