### Table Summary
* N per treamment per day and the mean +- survival
```{r F1 summary table means}

summ_F1 <- F1_survival %>%  na.omit() %>% summarySE(measurevar="Survival", groupvars=c("Age", "Treatment"))
summ_F1 %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
unique(summ_F1$Age) == unique(F1_survival$Age) # should all be true, the na omit above is essential for replicates w/o value later on..
```

### Plot it
```{r F1 plot raw counts}

# Comparing survival times between groups (log-rank test)
* We can conduct between-group significance tests using a log-rank test. The log-rank test equally weights observations over the entire follow-up time and is the most common way to compare survival times between groups. There are versions that more heavily weight the early or late follow-up that could be more appropriate depending on the research question (see ?survdiff for different test options).

* use binary_surv_df_MEANS

# The Cox regression model + Hazard Ratio

 * We may want to quantify an effect size for a single variable, or include **more than one variable** into a regression model to account for the effects of multiple variables.

* The Cox regression model is a semi-parametric model that can be used to fit univariable and multivariable regression models that have survival outcomes.

* use binary_surv_df - WE CAN ADDRESS REP HERE!


# Hazard ratio is equivalent to the exp(coef) in the coxpH model

  *  HR > 1 indicates an increased risk of death, An HR < 1, on the other hand, 
  indicates a decreased risk

  *  For example, a hazard ratio of 0.25 for treatment groups tells you 
  that individuals who received treatment  B have a reduced risk of dying compared 
  to patients who received treatment A

```{r cox  for multiple variables}

# Hazard ratio is equivalent to the exp(coef)
# HR > 1 indicates an increased risk of death, An HR < 1, on the other hand, indicates a decreased risk
# For example, a hazard ratio of 0.25 for treatment groups tells you that individuals who received treatment 
# B have a reduced risk of dying compared to patients who received treatment A



# run cox test on all data with replicate as a random factor
