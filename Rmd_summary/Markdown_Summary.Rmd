# Multigenerational Bay Scallop OA Exposure {#test}



We successfully created the F1 bay scallop cohort in late July 2021. These bay scallops were raised to maturity and spawned in August 2022 to create the F2 generation (Figure 1). Here we present a brief update of the data we have collected over the past year and where we are in our overall experimental plans. 

We have had many setbacks tin 2022 (Pseudomonas, pump failures, food issues, Vibrio), but after three spawnings, we were able to produce our F2 bay scallop generation. We collected a suite of physiology data during the F1 growout and Sam has made fantastic progress with library preparation for low coverage Whole Genome Sequencing and has sent his first test lane to be sequenced.

## F0 Broodstock and spawning

---

#### About Broodstock

  In late July 2021 we spawned bay scallops produced from Massachusetts broodstock (F0). We had initially hoped for two populations, but the Connecticut population are now scarce and what few broodstock we did find, did not survive transport to the lab and the conditioning period. 


#### Spawning and fertilization

  Spawning was induced using thermal adjustments up to 25°C. When an individual was observed to be spawning, it was removed from the spawning table and placed in a 1-L beaker with filtered seawater at 25°C to continue releasing gametes. To avoid self fertilization, scallops were switched to new beakers frequently to isolate sperm and egg from each individual. When eggs were observed to be released, the animal was immediately switched to a new cup and eggs were caught on a 25µm sieve to remove any sperm that remained in the beaker. Prior to fertilization, sperm was rinsed through a 20µm sieve to remove any eggs that may have remained in the cup. Fertilizations were completed in batches to assure gametes were fertilized within approximately 1 hour of release and for each batch fertilization, each individual used contributed only sperm or only eggs to avoid self fertilization. Embryos were checked frequently to assure fertilization was occurring and gametes were not pooled until > 85% of the embryos showed clear cell division. Eggs were used from a total of 13 individuals and sperm from a total of 16 individuals, of these 6 individuals supplied both sperm and egg, but never to the same fertilization set.

## Exposure to treatments

  After approximately 4 hours post fertilization, embryos from all batches were pooled and divided among 3 OA treatments (~400, 800, and 1600 µatm) with 5 replicates per treatment. Exposures were conducted in 10L filtered seawater at 27 psu and 23°C. Details of the chemistry for each OA treatment are detailed in Table 1.

### Grow Out (F1s)

At age 18 days, bay scallops were moved to the flow through system on downwellers with 200 µm mesh (Fig. 5). OA conditions were maintained in the flow through system by bubbling CO2 into columns prior to entering the exposure tanks and directly into the exposure tanks. We kept initial stocking densities high to assure we had enough for future spawning, but culled regularly to keep biomass from outgrowing the downweller. 

There were only enough spat produced in the moderate and low OA treatments to run the full replicated experiment. There were a total of 16 spat from the high OA treatment that were maintained in the system to test our ability to maintain all three treatments and collected some pilot data to inform experiments with the F2 jveniles. 


Figure 5: Experimental flow through set up
Experimental set up with downwellers and columns controlling pCO2 under flow through conditions. Although this does not directly represent the actual pH, we refer to the treatments as pH = 7, 7.5, and 8 for simplicity. 

Temperature varied overtime, but was controlled to keep from getting too warm in the summer or too cold in the winter (Fig. 6).  In spring 2022, F1 bay scallops were held at 16°C to condition for spawning and prevent uncontrolled spawning in the experimental system. While we had target pCO2 concentrations, there was some seasonal variation (Fig. 7) due to extreme variation in the incoming harbor water and therefore is a caveat of long term flow through experimental conditions.

### F1 Physiology 

Survival counts and shell length measurement were completed monthly and large batches of bay scallops were opportunistically frozen for dry weight measurements as cullings were required to prevent overcrowding. Respiration Rate and Clearance Rate were measured approximately monthly during the early spat stages. When the bay scallops were large enough to move into the big respiration chambers (out of the microrespiration system, 1.7mL), Excretion Rates were also measured. Once bay scallops were large enough (> 20mm) the biodeposition method was used to measure feeding metrics and Clearance Rate.  Physiological parameters were not measured during the overwintering period when metabolic activity is expected to be low, but resumed during the temperature ramp up in the late winter / early spring.

Table 3 summarizes the physiology measured for each time point. We are currently using length and weight data collected over the lifespan (September 2021-September 2022) to determine the best method for standardizing physiological rates to accomplish the most appropriate approach to metabolic scaling for our data. Once this is complete, we will include figures for these measurements that will be used to guide data collection during the F2 grow out.

### Larval development (F2s)


Several spawning attempts were made. Gonad development was evident in April and the first successful spawn was conducted. While spawning and fertilization was successful in April, after ~5 days of the full factorial experiment, it was evident that the larvae were crashing and after 10 days, 100% mortality was observed. Cause unknown. A second successful spawn was conducted in early July 2022, but at the water change and check at age 2 days old, heavy mortality was observed. After investigation, it was concluded that Vibrio was introduced through the food and the problem was fixed. A third and final spawn was conducted in late August 2022 with success (details below), but the egg output was low and we were unable to initiate the full factorial exposure and instead focused on just the creation of the F2 cohorts for each respective OA treatment (low and moderate - no high OA broodstock). Based on survival rates to date, we believe this was a wise decision. Fertilization rate was high (to first polar body), but progression to the multicellular stage after 4 hours was low (~20%). Food limitation (serious oyster population growing in the pipes from the harbor to the building) and several accidental spawnings due to pump failures while ripe scallops were being held could be part of the cause for a low output during this spawn. 

### Spawning and fertilization

Spawning was induced using thermal adjustments up to 25°C. When an individual was observed to be spawning, it was removed from the spawning table and placed in a 1-L beaker with filtered seawater at 25°C to continue releasing gametes. To avoid self fertilization, scallops were switched to new beakers frequently to isolate sperm and egg from each individual. When eggs were observed to be released, the animal was immediately switched to a new cup and eggs were caught on a 25µm sieve to remove any sperm that remained in the beaker. Prior to fertilization, sperm was rinsed through a 20µm sieve to remove any eggs that may have remained in the cup. Fertilizations were completed in batches to assure gametes were fertilized within approximately 1 hour of release and for each batch fertilization, each individual used contributed only sperm or only eggs to avoid self fertilization. Embryos were checked frequently to assure fertilization was occurring and gametes were not pooled until > 85% of the embryos showed clear cell division. Spawnings for the two cohorts (low and moderate OA) were conducted simultaneously and the number of males and females contributing to each cohort were kept constant. Eggs were used from a total of 11 individuals and sperm from a total of 11 individuals, of these 4 individuals supplied both sperm and egg, but never to the same fertilization set. 

Exposure to treatments
	After approximately 4 hours post fertilization, embryos from all batches were pooled and divided among 2 OA treatments (~400 and 800 µatm) with 3 replicates per treatment. Exposures were conducted in 10L filtered seawater at 27 psu and 23°C. Eggs were overstocked because of observations of stunted fertilization, so an initial embryo density was not accurately determined. Day 2 stocking density was 5-6 larvae / mL. Details of the chemistry for each OA treatment are detailed in Table 4.

### Grow Out (F2s)

F2 bay scallops were moved to the basement flow through system at age 23 days post fertilization and reared in downwelllers on 200µm mesh on drumfiltered seawater (30µm) at a temperature of ~22°C and salinity of 27-29. Spat were evenly distributed across 12 downwellers (n=4 for pH = 7.5 and n = 8 for pH =8). The first real counts were conducted 2 weeks after moving to the basement (9/21/22; age 36 dpf) and all downwellers were standardized to ~100 individuals per downweller. In addition to food coming in with the seawater from the harbor, diet was also supplemented with cultured phytoplankton (Chaet, T. iso, and PLY). 

The spat produced from pH=7.5 F1 broodstock reared in pH = 7.5 during the larval stage will continue to be reared in a pH of 7.5 for their lifespan (n=4). The pat produced from pH=8 F1 broodstock reared in pH = 8 during the larval stage, were split between two treatments for grow out, pH = 8 (n=4) and pH = 7 (n=4). The change from pH =8 to pH = 7 was gradual (0.1 pH units per week) and they were given a 2 week acclimation period to the flow through system before the pH drop was initiated. pH was slowly decreased over ~3 weeks
9/8/22 - moved to the basement (counts estimated based on volume, no length measurements)
9/21/22 - 2 wks after the move: pH still same as low OA treatment (length measurements and first real counts)
10/5/22 - 4 wks after the move: pH at to the mid treatment (length measurements and counts)
10/26/22 - 7 wks after the move: pH at to the high treatment (length measurements and counts)
11/16/22 - 10 weeks after the move: period of acclimation to the high OA treatment (Respiration Rates, length measurement, and counts)

The rationale for this is to obtain some physiological data under more extreme OA conditions. Because we were not able to produce larvae that could survive the extreme condition, exposure beginning as spat will help us to understand if other life stages are resilient to OA. Due to low survival in the pH = 7.5 during the static larval exposure, we did not have the numbers needed to also expose pH=7.5 spat to a pH=7 without risk of losing numbers and broodstock for a spawn to create the F3 generation, which is the primary goal of this project. 

Growth and survival will be monitored approximately monthly and physiology will be measured opportunistically when destructive sampling is feasible (ie. the main focus is rearing enough to have good broodstock numbers, so destructive sampling will only occur when a culling is required to reduce densities). 

Destructive sampling for genomics will be conducted during the first large culling requirement (November 17-18, 2022) and only the minimum number required will be sampled.

At the October 26 measurements theHigh OA treatment will have reached the High OA treatment target. 



Figure F: F2 juvenile growth: Mean shell length over time.
The high OA treatment (1200 µatm) started with juveniles raised in the loa OA treatment (500 µatm) and were slowly adjusted. At day 50, they reached the moderate OA treatment and at 71 days old, they reached the high OA treatment.

## Chemistry 
---

Discrete chemistry was measured daily for dissolved oxygen (mg L-1), salinity, and temperature (°C) in each treatment tank (YSI Model 556, Yellowspring, OH USA). Seawater samples were collected weekly in dark polypropylene bottles (500 mL) from each tank to measure pH, dissolved organic carbon (DIC, μmol kg-1), and total alkalinity (TA, μmol kg-1) via open-cell titration (SOP 3b; Dickson et al., 2007). DIC was measured on an Apollo SciTech DIC analyzer (Apollo SciTech, LLC, Newark, DE) which had a precision of 0.5% of assigned values in an interlaboratory comparison (Bockmon & Dickson, 2015).  TA was measured using certified HCl titrant (∼0.1 mol kg−1, ∼0.6 mol kg−1 NaCl; Dickson Lab, Batches 191 and 157) on a Metrohm alkalinity titrator (Mettler Toledo add here) with 0.17% mean error relative to certified reference materials (Dickson Lab CO2 CRM Batch 191 and 157). A UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Cary100, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to determine pH colorimetrically at 20oC with m-cresol purple indicator dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MS, Dickson & Goyet, 1994), with an error of ±0.0014 (seawater scale). Seawater DIC and pH were used in CO2SYS (Pierrot et al., 2006) for the calculation of partial pressure pCO2 (μatm), carbon ion constituents (bicarbonate HCO3- and carbonate CO3-2, μmol kg-1), and aragonite and calcite saturation state (Ωar and Ωca, respectively) using the following constants: K1, K2 from Lueker et al. (2000); potassium sulfate from Dickson (1990); and boron from Lee et al. (2010).
