![Figure 1: Experimental design. This figure has been adapted from our original proposal to reflect our current status and plans for FY23 and our final year of this project. Blue shading indicates stages that have been successfully completed and identifies where we are now in the three year plan. In the F2 growout, we used extra spat from the pH = 8 larval exposure to initiate a post settlement pH = 7 cohort. This is an alternative since we were not able to produce a pH=7 cohort that survived the larval exposure.](C:/Users/samjg/Documents/Github_repositories/Airradians_multigen_OA/Rmd_summary/images/Overivew.jpg)
